# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Explore PCA as a technique for discerning whether low-dimensional structure exists in a set of data and for finding good representations of the data in that subspace. We will do PCA on Iris dataset which can be loaded in scikit-learn using following commands:
```python 
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
```
1. Carry out a principal component analysis on the entire raw dataset (4-dimensional in- stances) for k = 1, 2, 3, 4 components. How much of variance in data can be explained by the first principal component? How does the fraction of variation explained in data vary as k varies?
2. Apply the preprocessing operations from on raw data set and repeat part (a) on processed data.
3. Project the raw four dimensional data down to a two dimensional subspace generated by first two top principle components (PCs) from part (b) and produce a scatter plot of the data. 
4. Use your k-means++ implementation to cluster data from part (c) into three clusters.
